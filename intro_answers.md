1. If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), 
how could you improve the display of the table?

Ans: The display of the table could be improved in a form of Pivot table. With that data summarization can be done. It can automatically sort, count total or calculate average of data rate. Filtering of data can also be done with Pivot tables.
This functionality is present in Excel sheet. This can be brought in HTML as well.
Different colors can be introduced to highlight different columns and based on the values the colors can be changed for good visual appearance.


2. Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.
Ans:

I. ProfilerViewer Control:

YUI's Profiler is a headless system for generating profiling data about the JavaScript functions that comprise your web application. The ProfilerViewer Control detailed here is used in combination with Profiler to provide rich visualizations of your profiling data â€” both graphically (using the Charts Control) and in tabular format (using DataTable).

II. Tables & Grids: Present Data in Familiar Spreadsheet Formats

The Table visualization (sometimes called a Grid) is a familiar way to communicate detailed information about relatively small sets of data. In most cases, people use a Table to display all the values in the set or sub-totals from a larger database
